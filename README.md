# XOR_Gate_Using_NeuralNetwork-
Wrote a function to depict the input to a neuron and included sigmoid activation function to get required output.Constructed a three-layer neural network to function as XOR gate using the neurons above and included a step activation function to the final neuron to get the output in 0 and 1.
